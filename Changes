    - Make the default behavior of sub compress to 
      quietly compress the input file as a tmp file 
      and write the compressed file to the input file
      name.
      + update docs and the compression bin files
        accordingly

    - Extracted the actual compression code
        to an exported subroutine ('xompress')
        suitable for use by other modules
    - Do not modify the input file name at
        all, but, if the output file name
        is NOT specified, strip off any
        suffix and replace it with
        '-NNNdpi.pdf'.
