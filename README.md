NAME
====

**Compress::PDF** - Provides PDF compression binary executables `compress-pdf` and its alias `pdf-compress`

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use Compress::PDF
```

In your terminal window:

    $ compress-pdf calendar.pdf
    # OUTPUT
    Input file: calendar.pdf
      Size: 2.9M
    Compressed output file: calendar-150dpi.pdf
      Size: 247.7K

DESCRIPTION
===========

**Compress::PDF** requires a system utitlity program: 'ps2pdf'. On Debian systems it can be installed by executing `sudo aptitude install ps2pdf`.

Installing this module results in an exported subroutine as well as one primary and one aliased Raku PDF compression programs:

  * sub compress($inpdf, :$quiet, :$dpi = 150, :$outpdf, :$force) is export {...}

  * compress-pdf

  * pdf-compress #= aliased to `compress-pdf`

Programs
--------

Executing either program name without input arguments results in:

    Usage: compress-pdf <pdf file> [..options...]

    Without options, the program compresses the input PDF file to the
      default 150 dpi.

    The input file is not modified, and the output file is
      named as the input file with any extension or suffix
      replaced by '-NNNdpi.pdf' where 'NNN' is the selected
      value of '150' (the default) or '300'.

    Options:
      dpi=X    - where X is the PDF compression level: '150' or '300' DPI.
      force    - allows overwriting an existing output file
      outpdf=X - where X is the desired output name

Note the the default output file will overwrite an existing file of the same name without warning.

Subroutine
----------

The subroutine has the following signature:

    sub compress($inpdf, :$quiet, :$dpi = 150,
                 :$outpdf, :$force) is export {...}

The `:$quiet` option is designed for use in programs where the user's desired output file name is designed to be quietly and seamlessly compressed by default. Other options provide more flexibilty and choices to offer the user if the `$quiet` option is **not** used.

If the `:$outpdf` is not entered, the `$outpdf` is named using the same scheme as the programs. The `:$force` option allows overwriting an existing file.
