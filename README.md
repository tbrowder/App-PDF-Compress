DESCRIPTION
===========

**Compress::PDF** requires a system utitlity program: 'ps2pdf'. On Debian systems it can be installed by executing `sudo aptitude install ps2pdf`.

Installing this module results in one primary and two aliased Raku PDF compression programs:

  * compress-pdf

  * pdf-compress #= aliased to `compress-pdf`

    Without options, compresses the input PDF file to the
      default 150 dpi.

    The input file is not modified, and the output file is
      named as the input file with the extension '.pdf'
      replaced by '-NNNdpi.pdf' where 'NNN' is the selected
      value of '150' (the default) or '300'.

    Options:
        dpi=X - where X is the PDF compression level: '150' or '300' DPI.
